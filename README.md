Before you begin, you should familiarize yourself with the dataset.

## Project steps:

1.
- Data pre-processing: get rid of the noise 
- Think of the baseline linear learner and any other ML method that we will use.

2. Implement the classifier naively without any optimisation/strategy
3. Watch the results 
4. Optimization: Make decisions about training/validation split, distribution choice for naive bayes, regularization strategy, any optimization tricks, setting hyper-parameters, etc. 
5. Watch the results 
6. And so on..
