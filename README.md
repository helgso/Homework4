Before you begin, you should familiarize yourself with the dataset.

## Project steps:

1. Data pre-processing: get rid of the noise 
2. Implement the classifiers naively without any optimisation/strategy
- baseline linear learner: SVM or logistic regression
- other method: Random forest and convnet
3. Watch the results 
4. Optimization: 
Try to optimize Random forest and Convnet:
Make decisions about training/validation split, distribution choice for naive bayes, regularization strategy, any optimization tricks, setting hyper-parameters, etc. 
5. Watch the results 
6. And so on..
7. Take the one that gives the best results between Random forest and Convnet
8. Compare with the baseline linear learner
